# Form-snippet
In this code snippet, we're using the useState hook to manage the form data. The handleChange function updates the form data as the user types in the input fields. The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted, where you can handle the form data according to your specific requirements (e.g., sending it to an API endpoint, performing validation, etc.).

Feel free to modify the form fields, add additional fields, or include any validation or API requests that are relevant to your hackathon project. Good luck!
